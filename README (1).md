# Enterprise Budget Allocation and Action-Based Fund Release

1. **Budget Allocation & Action Planning:**
   * Enterprises allocate a specific budget for CSR activities via the platform.
   * They create green tasks and assign a ‘charity unlock value’ (CUV) to each task. CUV represents the amount to be released to charities upon successful task completion.
2. **Employee Actions and Budget Release:**
   * As employees successfully complete tasks, the assigned CUV for each task gets moved to a ‘Pending Donations Pool’ (PDP).
   * The PDP accumulates funds with each completed action, ensuring the donation release is directly tied to actual employee actions.
3. **Voting and Fund Distribution:**
   * The voting mechanism begins, wherein employees and validators cast votes for charities.
   * The accumulated PDP is distributed to the chosen charities based on voting results after each voting round.



#### Detailed Workflow:

**Pre-Voting Phase:**

* **Task Definition:** Enterprises define tasks and assign corresponding CUVs.
* **Budget Locking:** Enterprises lock a budget corresponding to total possible CUVs to ensure fund availability.
* **Task Completion & PDP Accumulation:** Employees complete tasks, validated by validators, and CUVs transfer to the PDP.

**Voting Phase:**

* **Voting Eligibility:** Ensure sufficient funds in the PDP to validate a voting round.
* **Voting Rounds:** Initiated either after the PDP reaches a certain threshold or after a predefined time, ensuring a balanced approach considering both action and time-based triggers.
* **Vote Weight:** Both employees and validators participate, with voting weight defined by token holdings or a predetermined logic to ensure fairness and incentive.

**Post-Voting Phase:**

* **Distribution:** Funds from the PDP are distributed to the selected charities.
* **Transparency Reports:** Details of the donations, task completions, and voting results are made public for transparency.
* **Impact Stories:** Charities can share the impact created with the received funds, boosting morale and showcasing real-world effects.

**Continuous Engagement:**

* **Feedback & Recognition:** Acknowledge enterprises, employees, and validators through various feedback and recognition mechanisms.
* **Adjust & Optimize:** Enterprises can assess the impact, employee participation, and optimize future task definitions and CUV allocations.

**Note:**

* Ensure a user-friendly experience and clear guidance for enterprises to define tasks, allocate budgets, and understand the entire workflow for smooth operation and engagement.
