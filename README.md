# GreenPrize

## Introduction
GreenPrize incentivizes and validates corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives through community-driven verification on the blockchain. Company employees can earn and donate crypto rewards for verified sustainability and social impact actions, events and activities. Companies can work on increasing their ESG scores and positioning themselves as an ecofriendly brand.

## Overview
* Users (companies) submit verifiable evidence of CSR activities to the GreenPrize platform.
* The submissions are evaluated for validity through a decentralized community validation process.
* Validated CSR activities earn the companies and the validators tradable GreenPrize (GPR) tokens as rewards for their efforts.
* The tokens can then be donated to various charities and organizations to further promote sustainability and social initiatives.
* GPR is both a utility and governance token used for voting on proposals, staking and validating, rewards for various actions, and payments/commissions on the platform.
* A dual token model with GPR and USDC aligns incentives for stakeholders.

## Validating CSR Activities
The validation process uses cryptoeconomic mechanisms to align incentives:

* Validators review evidence submissions.
* They stake GPR tokens to participate and vote on validity.
* Rewards are distributed to honest validators for quality work.
* Enough "yes" votes (based on stake) verify the activity and release the rewards.
* This decentralized approach creates a permanent record of corporate CSR initiatives on the blockchain.

## Why Participate
* Company - Earn rewards (& donates them) for CSR efforts while enhancing brand image and engaging employees
* Validators - Get paid in GPR for contributing to ecosystem governance and validation.
